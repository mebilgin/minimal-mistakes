In this talk, we talked about traditional machine learning methods and deep learning methods and the differences between them. I talked about the differences, advantages, disadvantages and applications of deep learning from traditional machine learning. I also talked about the new perspectives and new research areas that deep learning brings to our lives.
We examined various applications on innovations and computational methods brought by deep learning, especially in image and autonomous systems.
