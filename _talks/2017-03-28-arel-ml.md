In this session, we talked about the equivalent of statistics and probability science in machine learning, which pieces of the puzzle represent, and probabilistic and statistical perspectives.
<br>
During the session, we talked about Markov model, Monte Carlo model, Markov Chain Monte Carlo, Metropolis-Hastings and Viterbi Algorithms. We talked about the applications of these models and algorithms in machine learning and their basis in theory.
