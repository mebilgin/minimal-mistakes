We built the foundations of this meeting on computational methods in machine learning. Tensor, Hadoop, Distributed Machine Learning and Application and Optimization Methods; Convex and Concave functions

In this talk, I talked about Tensor methods in the section reserved for me. I talked about the place of Tensor factorization, Tensor decomposition, Tensor Approximation and Tensor methods in machine learning.
