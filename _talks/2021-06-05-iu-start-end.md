In this meeting, we talked about the milestones that machine learning has passed from its beginning to the present and the level we have reached. We evaluated the first stone that Turing threw into the water and the subsequent developments chronologically. Then we talked about all the milestones. We have conducted various future-oriented brainstorms and the level of classical machine learning, natural language processing, neural machine translation, video processing and real time processing, deep learning and computation methods from the past to the present.
