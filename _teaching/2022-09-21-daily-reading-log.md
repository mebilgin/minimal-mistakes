Due to my business life, I could not find time to read, write and produce for a long time. During this time, besides the tiredness of business life, I took some time to listen to myself. That's why I decided to write my first blog post [Creating and producing time](). During this time, I share the contents that I read and take notes without any date information. I did not have the chance to read much, but I can say that the contents I read contributed a lot to my knowledge.
