Today, I mostly read on monte carlo with tensor and optimization techniques. You can find the resources I read below.

- [Scalable Second Order Optimization for Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09018)
- [Tensor train completion: local recovery guarantees via Riemannian optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.03975)
- [Why Machine Learning Cannot Ignore Maximum Likelihood Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.12112)
- [Monte Carlo simulation with tensor network states](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.83.134421)
