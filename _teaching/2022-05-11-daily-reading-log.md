Today, I mostly read on monte carlo with tensor and optimization techniques. You can find the resources I read below.

- [Conditional Random Fields: Probabilistic Models for Segmenting and Labeling Sequence Data](https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1162&context=cis_papers)
- [Deep contextualized word representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05365)
- [Stochastic Inversion Transduction Grammars and Bilingual Parsing of Parallel Corpora ](https://www.lri.fr/~waller/cours/fr/articles/2008/yvon4.pdf)
